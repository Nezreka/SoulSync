# BREAKING CHANGE (v1.3+): Database volume mount changed from /app/database to /app/data
# If upgrading from a previous version, update your docker-compose.yml:
#   OLD: - soulsync_database:/app/database
#   NEW: - soulsync_database:/app/data
# Your data will be preserved - it's the same volume, just mounted at a different path.
