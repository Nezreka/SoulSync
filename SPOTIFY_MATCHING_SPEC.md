# Spotify Matched Download System - Technical Specification

## Expected Use Case for a single(mostly the same for album?)
User clicks 'matched download' button on a 'single'  and an elegant modal expands into view that offers two options: the top half (spotify auto matching with a list or slideshow or top 5 likely artists), the bottom half(manual use search on spotify to match the track to an artist). the app will use spotify metadata to update the track name and create the folder structure I detailed. so lets talk about the top half of the modal first. It will automatically populate the top 5 most likely artists to match the track with. each likely artist will display, if possible, the artist image, artist name, and percentage likelihood of match. clicking the artist will select that artist as the matched artist and the download will begin. now the bottom half:  it will be a simple but elegant search bar for the user to search for an artist and it will display a list of 5 results similar to the top half but these results are user searched. it will display the same content, artist picture, artist name, percentage liklihood of match. clicking the artist will select that artist as the matched artist and the download will begin. So now that the user has decided which artist the track belongs to the track has begun downloading as normal to the download folder. the track and its parent folder will then appear in the downloads folder once complete. but while the track is downloading the app should attempt to gather additional information about the artist / album / track. specifically we will need to see if the track we downloaded was part of an album and if it is, make sure we create the correct folder structure. if a track is a single. it is layed out like this:
```
Transfer/
├── EXAMPLE ARTIST/
│   ├── EXAMPLE ARTIST - EXAMPLE SINGLE/
    ├── EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
    ├── cover.png/jpg
```
if we determine a track we downloaded is part of an album by the matched artist it would be setup like this:

```
Transfer/
├── EXAMPLE ARTIST/
│   ├── EXAMPLE ARTIST - EXAMPLE ALBUM/
        ├── TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        ├── cover.png/jpg
```

If we happen to download multiple tracks from the same album they should all end up with the same folder structure and in the same location.

```
Transfer/
├── EXAMPLE ARTIST/
│   ├── EXAMPLE ARTIST - EXAMPLE ALBUM/
        ├── TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        ├── TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        ├── TRACK# EXAMPLE SINGLE.flac
        ├── cover.png/jpg
        ├── ...
    
```

All accurate title information and cover art for albums, tracks, artists can be found with the matched artist via spotify api. this information is used to for renaming tracks and folders. That way we know tracks and albums will end up together with albums and artists having the exact same name. After we determine if the track is part of an album or not we can begin copying the download to the 'transfer' folder and creating the appropriate folder structure from above and rename the track as needed. After the folder structure is setup correctly we will begin updating the metadata within the actual track file based on the data pulled from spotify. Things like title, track number, genres, album, contributing artists and anything else spotify api provides. once folder structure is done and metadata data for all tracks is done, then delete the original download in the downloads folder and run 'clear completed' buttons function. now with everything cleaned up we can move on to the next matched download.

Now we need to incorporate this functionality into full album downloads by adding a 'matched album download' button beside the 'download album' button. this will essentially do the exact same process as singles but its a big batch added to the queue. we can't assume what we are downloading is an actual 'album' by an artist but could instead be a folder of a users favorite songs. but our app would download those songs and put them in the correct artist folder with correct metadata. if you think im missing intuitive or critical please add it in.

If we fail to match an artist in the modal, treat the download as a normal downoad without any matching and keep it in the downloads folder. Also any matched downloads need to update the 'download queue' the same way a normal download would. The cancel button should remain functional on a matched download in the queue and clicking it should behave exaclty the same. a finished matched download should transfer to finished downloads as expected.

Remix should be handled elegantly. If artist A does a remix of Artist B song. The song artist will be Artist A with a contributting artist of Artist B.
the matching system should be super extensive and robust and professional. at the level of Spotify, Google, Facebook and Apple. So logical, practical and sophisticated it would make them proud. I provided how i want this to play out. I expect a 'Matched Download' button do appear on all singles and all tracks inside albums beside the 'download' button. and albums should  have a matched download button as well that match downloads all tracks in the album. The modal should be beautiful, elegant, and provide space for content to fit. We should be very smart with our api calls to spotify so we don't reach limits. If it doesn't need to be in another file, then don't put it in one. you can do this. Give your best work. I'ts also very important that you come to this document and update the TODO list with what you are doing, what you are going to do next. And udpating the TODO list at each step.

## DOWNLOAD MISSING TRACKS - NEW FEATURE SPECIFICATION

### Feature Overview
A new "Download Missing Tracks" button on playlist sync modals that intelligently downloads only tracks that don't exist in Plex, with proper folder organization mimicking the matched download system.

### Core Workflow

1. **Button Click**: User clicks "Download Missing Tracks" on a playlist in sync modal
2. **Plex Check**: If Plex is connected, analyze each track for existence with high confidence matching (≥0.8)
3. **Track Processing**: For each missing track:
   - Search Soulseek using: `{TrackName}` first, then `{ArtistName} {TrackName}` if needed
   - Apply intelligent filtering to find best quality match
   - Queue download with custom folder structure
4. **Folder Organization**: Use same structure as matched downloads:
   - **Album tracks**: `ArtistName/ArtistName - AlbumName/Track.ext`
   - **Singles**: `ArtistName/ArtistName - TrackName/Track.ext`
5. **Failed Matches**: Save tracks that can't be matched with high certainty for manual review

### Technical Requirements

#### Plex Integration
- Use intelligent track matching with confidence scoring
- If Plex unavailable/unreachable: download ALL tracks in playlist
- Per-track analysis with real-time progress feedback

#### Search Strategy
- Primary: Search by track name only
- Fallback: Search by artist + track name
- Use existing search filtering for quality/format preferences
- Modern, performant async operations

#### Folder Structure
- **NOT** `Transfer/[PLAYLIST_NAME]/` as originally specified
- **INSTEAD**: Use matched download structure:
  - Singles: `ArtistName/ArtistName - TrackName/Track.ext`
  - Albums: `ArtistName/ArtistName - AlbumName/Track.ext`
- Leverage existing downloads.py folder organization logic
- Automatic album vs single detection using Spotify metadata

#### Performance & API Efficiency
- Smart Spotify API usage to avoid rate limits
- Batch operations where possible
- Background processing with progress tracking
- Minimal changes to existing downloads.py infrastructure

### Implementation Strategy

#### Extend Existing Downloads.py

- Use existing folder organization patterns from matched downloads
- Integrate with current download progress tracking

#### Data Flow
```
Playlist Track → Plex Check → (Missing) → Soulseek Search → Quality Filter → Queue Download → Folder Organization
```

#### Error Handling
- Network failures: Continue with remaining tracks
- Search failures: Log for manual review
- Plex unavailable: Download all tracks
- API limits: Implement backoff/retry logic

### User Experience
- Real-time progress indication during Plex analysis
- Clear feedback on skipped vs queued tracks
- Integration with existing download queue UI
- Optional: Progress tracking for playlist download completion

### Success Criteria
- Seamless integration with existing download infrastructure
- No modifications needed to core downloads.py functionality

## 🚀 CURRENT STATE & NEXT PHASE IMPROVEMENTS

### ✅ CURRENT WORKING STATE (What's Working Now):

#### **Core Functionality Complete:**
1. **Modal System**: Sophisticated UI with live counters, dual progress bars, track table
2. **Plex Analysis**: Background thread analyzes tracks against Plex library
3. **Smart Search**: Single-word tracks prioritize artist inclusion, multi-word tracks work well
4. **Download Integration**: Uses existing downloads.py infrastructure properly
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates, modal can be closed/reopened
6. **Folder Structure**: Basic folder creation for downloaded tracks

#### **Search Strategy Working:**
- ✅ "Aether Virtual Mage" → finds correct Virtual Mage track
- ✅ "Astral Chill" → finds correct track 
- ✅ "Orbit Love" → finds correct track
- ✅ Downloads integrate with existing queue system
- ✅ Sequential searching prevents overwhelming slskd

### ⚠️ CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED (Next Phase):

#### **1. INTELLIGENT MATCHING SYSTEM**
**Current Issue**: System is finding tracks but not always selecting the best quality/match
**Requirements**:
- **FLAC Priority**: When multiple valid matches exist, always choose FLAC over MP3/other formats
- **Advanced Title Parsing**: Handle track names with extra characters like:
  - `Artist - Track Name [320kbps]`
  - `01. Track_Name - Artist_Name.flac`
  - `Track Name (feat. Other Artist) - 2023 Remaster`
- **Bitrate Recognition**: Parse and prefer higher quality files
- **Version Filtering**: Avoid unwanted remixes, live versions, instrumentals unless specified

#### **2. SPOTIFY INTEGRATION FOR FOLDER STRUCTURE**
**Current Issue**: Downloads go to basic folders without proper Spotify metadata integration
**Requirements**:
- **Must work exactly like "matched downloads"** from the main downloads.py functionality
- **Spotify API Lookup**: For each track, find exact Spotify match for metadata
- **Album Detection**: Determine if track is part of album or is a single
- **Proper Folder Structure**:
  - **Singles**: `Transfer/ARTIST_NAME/ARTIST_NAME - SINGLE_NAME/SINGLE_NAME.flac`
  - **Albums**: `Transfer/ARTIST_NAME/ARTIST_NAME - ALBUM_NAME/01 TRACK_NAME.flac`
- **Cover Art**: Download album/artist artwork automatically
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Update file tags with Spotify metadata

#### **3. CONFIDENCE-BASED AUTO-MATCHING**
**Current Issue**: No systematic tracking of failed matches or confidence thresholds
**Requirements**:
- **High Confidence Auto-Download**: Tracks with >80% confidence match automatically
- **Medium Confidence Review**: 60-80% confidence tracks flagged for manual review
- **Failed Matches List**: Maintain list of tracks that couldn't be matched reliably
- **Manual Search Integration**: Allow manual search for failed tracks
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Show user statistics on match success rates

#### **4. ENHANCED QUALITY SELECTION ALGORITHM**
**Current Scoring System Improvements Needed**:
```python
# Current basic scoring needs enhancement:
# - Track name containment: 120-150 points
# - Artist containment: 40-80 points  
# - Duration matching: Up to 100 points

# NEEDED: Advanced quality scoring:
# - FLAC/Lossless: +50 points (higher than current +15)
# - High bitrate: +30 points (320kbps vs 128kbps)
# - Clean filename: +20 points (avoid [tags], underscores)
# - Proper metadata: +15 points (correct artist/title fields)
# - Album context: +10 points (part of complete album)
```

### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:

#### **Phase 1: FLAC Priority & Quality Enhancement** (Immediate)
1. Update `select_best_match()` scoring in `sync.py:2955`
2. Add FLAC detection and boost scoring significantly
3. Implement bitrate parsing and quality preference
4. Add file format detection improvements

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Matching Intelligence** (Critical)
1. Enhanced track title parsing with regex patterns
2. Improved artist name normalization and matching
3. Context-aware matching (album context, release year, etc.)
4. Machine learning-style confidence scoring improvements

#### **Phase 4: Failed Matches & Manual Review** (Important)
1. Failed matches tracking and storage
2. Manual search interface for problem tracks
3. Success rate analytics and reporting
4. User feedback integration for match quality

### 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- **90%+ automatic match rate** for popular tracks
- **FLAC preference** ensuring highest quality downloads
- **Perfect folder organization** matching existing matched download standards
- **Zero manual intervention** for high-confidence matches
- **Clear manual review workflow** for edge cases

1. **Update FLAC priority** in matching algorithm
2. **Add Spotify metadata lookup** for proper folder structure
3. **Enhance track title parsing** for better matching accuracy
4. **Implement confidence thresholds** for auto vs manual matching

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE: INCORRECT FILE NAMING AND FOLDER STRUCTURE

#### **Current Problem - DOWNLOAD MISSING TRACKS**
The current "Download Missing Tracks" implementation has a **CRITICAL FLAW** in how it handles file naming and folder organization:

**❌ CURRENT WRONG BEHAVIOR:**
1. System searches slskd for tracks based on Spotify playlist track names
2. When match is found, uses **PLAYLIST TRACK METADATA** for folder/file naming
3. **RESULT:** Can download wrong song but rename it correctly, making it appear successful
4. **EXAMPLE:** Downloads "Random Song.flac" → renames to "Orbit Love by Virtual Mage" in correct folder

**✅ REQUIRED CORRECT BEHAVIOR (Like Matched Downloads):**
1. Find slskd track result using playlist search
2. Extract **ACTUAL TRACK TITLE** from the slskd result filename/metadata
3. Search **SPOTIFY API** with the slskd track title to find correct artist
4. Use **SPOTIFY API RESPONSE** metadata for folder/file naming (not playlist metadata)
5. **RESULT:** File naming reflects what was actually downloaded

#### **Implementation Flow - Download Missing Tracks Should Work Like Matched Downloads:**
```
Playlist Track → slskd Search → slskd Result Found → 
Extract slskd Track Title → Spotify API Search(slskd_title) → 
Spotify Match → Use Spotify Metadata for Naming → Download + Organize
```

**This matches exactly how the main downloads page "matched downloads" work:**
- User clicks "Matched Download" on slskd result
- System extracts track title from slskd result  
- Searches Spotify API with extracted title
- Uses Spotify API response for folder structure and metadata
- Downloads and organizes with correct naming

#### **Why This Is Critical:**
- **Data Integrity:** File names must reflect actual downloaded content
- **Consistency:** Must match behavior of existing matched download system
- **User Trust:** Prevents false positive downloads that appear successful but are wrong
- **Library Organization:** Ensures Transfer folder contains accurately named content

### 🤔 FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS (May Be Overkill):

#### **Advanced Spotify API Validation**
**Concept:** After finding slskd match, extract artist/title from result and re-query Spotify API to double-validate
**Flow:** slskd result → extract metadata → Spotify API lookup → compare to original → approve/reject
**Pros:** Ultimate validation accuracy, consistent with matched download system
**Cons:** Extra API calls, rate limiting concerns, added complexity, slower performance
**Decision:** ~~Current strict title+artist matching may be sufficient~~ **REQUIRED** - This is exactly what matched downloads do and what Download Missing Tracks should do
